# 2. Teaching Assistant Programming with Python
In the second year of my masterâ€™s, I was also a teaching assistant for the second-year Civil Engineering Bachelor course Programming with Python (CTB2000). I took this opportunity since it closely aligned with my interests, and I like to help people. This course was taught during the whole second year, but I was only an assistant during the first three quarters. During a quarter students had to work through one Python notebook every week in which several topics were addressed. Then, in week 6 of the quarter, there was a test to assess students on these topics and in week eight students had the opportunity to resit one notebook. 

**Responsibilities**\
During the course, the teaching assistants were tasked with several things. First of all, we had to be present two days a week in lecture halls to answer questions from students. This included questions about how Python worked, the theory behind Python and the theory behind the weekly topics.

Furthermore, the responsible lecturer asked us each to make two exercises on the weekly topics. From this pool of questions, he then selected five questions for the individual exam of week six and five for the resit in week eight. 

**What did I learn**\
During the period of assisting this course, I learned a lot about conveying information to people who are not on the same level of understanding as myself. Furthermore, I gained a lot of in-depth additional knowledge on Python which will be useful for my future career.

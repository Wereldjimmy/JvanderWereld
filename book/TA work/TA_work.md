# Teaching Assistant work

In the second year of my master's degree, I started doing teaching assistant work for the faculty of Civil Engineering. Before being a teaching assistant, I always tutored high school students on the topics of math and physics, but I wanted a step up. So, I started applying for teaching assistant jobs and even got offered a job. 

These teaching assistant jobs taught me more about how to work together to finish a project before a hard deadline and how to communicate with your client, the responsible lecturer in this case. In the next sections, you will find a description of the teaching assistant jobs I did and the things I learned during it.

# 1. Teaching Assistent Concrete and Steel Structures
During my second year of my master’s, I was asked to be a teaching assistant of the second-year Civil Engineering Bachelor course Concrete and Steel Structures (CTB2220-14). This course teaches students the basics of how to design concrete and steel structures and teaches them how to work with the Eurocodes. My task was to create an individual assignment for students in an online environment that walks through all the design steps of concrete and steel elements including: 

- Calculating characteristic and design loads
- Calculating resistances of:
    - Steel beams, columns and connections
    - Concrete beams and columns

This online assignment was made in the software called Ans, which automatically assigns students certain parameters and grades numerical answers based on a python script. 

**Structure**\
To combine all the several learning objectives of this course an overall structure was chosen. The design of the structure can be found in the figure below.

The structure includes concrete and steel beams, and concrete and steel columns. The mechanical models were then created which students had to use for calculations.

**Assignment layout**\
The assignment consisted of four parts, each dedicated to specific topics of the course.

*Part 1: Safety*\
The assignment started of with a part called ‘Safety’, in this part students had to calculate the self-weight of several elements with which forces in the structure were calculated. In addition to the permanent load on the structure, variable load was considered including snow loading and wind loading.

*Part 2: Steel and concrete beam*\
The second part of the assignment consisted of assessing the structural integrity of the steel and concrete beams in the structure. For the concrete beam this also included calculations on the reinforcement and crack width according to the Eurocodes.

*Part 3: Steel connection*\
In the third part students had to calculate the strength of a steel bolted and welded connection in the structure. This included calculating the resistance against several failure mechanisms and determining the governing one.

*Part 4: Steel and concrete column*\
In the fourth and last part of the assignment students were asked to assess the steel and concrete beams in the structure. This included performing a buckling resistance analysis and creating a moment-normal force interaction diagram for the concrete columns.

**Other Responsibilities**\
Aside from being tasked with creating the previously mentioned assignment, we, as teaching assistants, we were also responsible for answering student questions on an online forum, being present during weekly meetings with the managing lecturer whom we closely collaborated with during the course, and being present during the two partial exams and resit.

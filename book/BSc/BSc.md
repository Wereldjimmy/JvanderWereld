# BSc Civil Engineering

I started my bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at the Technical University Delft in September of 2020. During this time COVID-19 was almost at its peak and the campus of the university was almost completely closed. Fortunately, first-year students were allowed to be on campus during the start of the year one day a week. During these on-campus days, we had lectures and seminars together with our mentor group (a group of ten first-year students and a mentor who helped us get used to university) for the courses we followed at that time. After a while, we were not allowed to be on campus anymore and had to do everything online from home. I was fine with this and started focussing on passing all my exams, which I then did.

During my second year, there was more space for students to come to campus and work with other students. This was good since I did not meet a lot of students at that time apart from my mentor group. Throughout the year we started going to campus more and more, until the point we were finally back to normal. During the summer of this year, I even attended a study tour to Canada and the United States in which we visited many companies, projects and universities. During this tour, I developed an interest in doing a double master’s degree and decided to work hard for this.

My third year started with a minor of my choice. I chose the minor Project Management: from Nano to Mega, during which I started to develop managerial skills and interests. During this minor, there was a project in which I worked with students from other faculties to design a new campus building which included student housing, lecture halls, and study spaces. After completing this minor, I did five courses, from which two I had to choose myself. I focused on mechanics and concrete structures. In the last quarter of my bachelor's degree, I did my bachelor's thesis on the topic of self-healing 3D-printed concrete. My bachelor thesis was awarded with an 8.5 which concluded my cum laude graduation.

# 2. Vierhaven Redevelopment
For my second project, I was part of a team of ten students tasked with making a redevelopment plan for the Vierhavens area in Rotterdam as part of the course Integrated Design and Management (CTB1220-14). This project included several aspects of real-life planning, such as stakeholder analysis, cost analysis, and the creation of 3D models using BIM software.

**Background and Problem Statement**\
Rotterdam is a rapidly growing city with increasing demand for housing. This resulted in the need for redevelopment of the Vierhavens area, which is currently an industrial area but has the potential for transformation into a mixed-use urban space. The project aimed to create a sustainable living, working, and recreational environment. On top of that, a new river crossing over the Nieuwe Maas is planned to improve connectivity.

**Design and Planning Considerations**\
The redevelopment of the area was based on five principles:

1. Public transport is the backbone of urban expansion.
2. Attractive mixed-use environments to enhance interaction.
3. Strengthening the urban structure by integrating new and existing developments.
4. Future-proof neighbourhoods that are sustainable and climate-resilient.
5. Transformation of the industrial zone into a vibrant urban district.

During this project, we worked out several designs: a sustainable design, a cost-effective design, and a traditional design. I was part of the design team tasked to create a traditional design which focussed on creating a visually appealing neighbourhood with classic architecture and a traditional urban feel. For the design, I was tasked with making a 3D visualisation of a new river crossing which included the traditional style of the area.

**Proposed solution**\
The proposed solution of the report was a mix of all three designs. The final solution contained at least 1500 new homes, mixed with offices and recreational areas, improved tram and bus connectivity, a car-free policy, climate adaptations such as solar panels, green roofs and aqua thermal energy, and economic and social development.

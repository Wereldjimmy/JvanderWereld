## Project Analysis Zandhazenbrug

The first project I did at the Technical University Delft was a project analysis of the Zandhazenbrug. This is a railway bridge near Muiderberg that needed to be redesigned after the A1 highway was widened. The bridge was designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.

**Project Statement**\
Increasing traffic between Almere and Schiphol caused frequent congestion at the Muiderberg interchange. The A1 was widened from 2x3 to 2x5 lanes, making the existing railway bridge insufficient. Rijkswaterstaat decided to construct a new railway bridge without intermediate supports to maintain flexibility.

**Technology and Design**
- The bridge features a steel frame made of **S460 steel**, ensuring strength and weight reduction.
- To **minimize noise pollution**, vibration dampers and a concrete conduit were installed.
- The bridge spans 255 meters, making it the **longest railway bridge in the Netherlands**.

**Alternative solutions**\
As part of the analysis, I investigated other potential solutions:

1. **Rail tunnel** – costly and technically challenging.
2. **Direct A6/A9 connection** – would impact nature reserves.
3. **Level crossing** – unsuitable due to traffic disruption.

The railway bridge proved to be the best choice, despite some drawbacks, such as its visibility in the landscape.

**Results**\
As a result of the railway bridge and widening of the highway traffic congestion at Muiderberg decreased by 80%. The bridge also won the National Steel Award in 2018. However, despite mitigation measures, residents still experience noise pollution.

This project combined stakeholder analysis, looking into novel techniques, and studying decision and contract formation.

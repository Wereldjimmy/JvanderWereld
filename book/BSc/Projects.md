# Projects
This page contains the projects I did during my bachelor's degree Civil Engineering at the Technical University Delft.

## Project Analysis Zandhazenbrug

The first project I did at the Technical University Delft was a project analysis of the Zandhazenbrug as part of the course Introduction to Civil Engineering (CTB1120-14). This is a railway bridge near Muiderberg that needed to be redesigned after the A1 highway was widened. The bridge was designed to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.

**Project Statement**\
Increasing traffic between Almere and Schiphol caused frequent congestion at the Muiderberg interchange. The A1 was widened from 2x3 to 2x5 lanes, making the existing railway bridge insufficient. Rijkswaterstaat decided to construct a new railway bridge without intermediate supports to maintain flexibility.

**Technology and Design**
- The bridge features a steel frame made of **S460 steel**, ensuring strength and weight reduction.
- To **minimize noise pollution**, vibration dampers and a concrete conduit were installed.
- The bridge spans 255 meters, making it the **longest railway bridge in the Netherlands**.

**Alternative solutions**\
As part of the analysis, I investigated other potential solutions:

1. **Rail tunnel** – costly and technically challenging.
2. **Direct A6/A9 connection** – would impact nature reserves.
3. **Level crossing** – unsuitable due to traffic disruption.

The railway bridge proved to be the best choice, despite some drawbacks, such as its visibility in the landscape.

**Results**\
As a result of the railway bridge and widening of the highway traffic congestion at Muiderberg decreased by 80%. The bridge also won the National Steel Award in 2018. However, despite mitigation measures, residents still experience noise pollution.

This project combined stakeholder analysis, looking into novel techniques, and studying decision and contract formation.

## Vierhaven Redevelopment
For my second project I was part of a team of ten students tasked with making a redevelopment plan for the Vierhavens area in Rotterdam as part of the course Integrated Design and Management (CTB1220-14). This project included several aspects of real life planning, such as stakeholder analysis, cost analysis, and the creation of 3D models using BIM software.

**Background and Problem statement**\
Rotterdam is a rapidly growing cities with increasing demand for housing. This resulted in the need for redevelopment of the Vierhavens area, which is currently an industrial area but has potential for transformation into a mixed-use urban space. The project aimed to create a sustainable living, working, and recreational environment. On top of that, a new river crossing over the Nieuwe Maas is planned to improve connectivity.

**Design and Planning considerations**\
The redevelopment of the area was based on five principles:

1. Public transport as the backbone of urban expansion.
2. Attractive mixed-use environments to enhance interaction.
3. Strengthening the urban structure by integrating new and existing developments.
4. Future-proof neighbourhoods that are sustainable and climate-resilient.
5. Transformation of the industrial zone into a vibrant urban district.

During this project we worked out several designs: sustainable design, cost-effective design, and a traditional design. I was part of the design team tasked to create a traditional design which focussed on creating a visually appealing neighbourhood with classic architecture and a traditional urban feel. For the design, I was tasked with making a 3D-visualisation of a new river crossing which included the traditional style of the area.

**Proposed solution**\
The proposed solution of the report was a mix of all three designs. The final solution contained least 1500 new homes, mixed with offices and recreational areas, improved tram and bus connectivity, a car-free policy, climate adaptations such as solar panels, green roofs and aqua thermal energy, and economic and social development.

## Sustainability of a Bridge
As part of the course Construction Materials and Sustainability (CTB1320) I analysed a bridge in Roelofarendsveen by calculating the Environmental Cost Indicator (MKI) value. This approach is used in the Netherlands to quantify the environmental impact of civil structures. First a 3D model was made in the software Tekla from which a quantity statement was gathered that contained the exact weight of materials used in the bridge.

```

With this quantity statement the environmental impact indicator values are calculated for each material in the bridge and, on top of that, the environmental impact is assessed on the basis of several environmental impact categories such as abiotic depletion, global warming, and ozone layer depletion.

The total impact of the bridge on the environment turned out to be €24,200, which the majority coming from human toxicity.

# 4. Water in Somotillo
For the course Urban Water and Environmental Engineering (CTB2121) I was tasked with making a design of a water supply and wastewater management system for Somotillo, a small city in Nicaragua.

**Background and Problem Statement**\
Somotillo is a small city in Nicaragua with a population of 29,0330 and is located near the Rio El Gallo, a river that is already polluted by upstream cities. Since Somotillo struggled with water distribution due to economic and geographical challenges my task was to design a safe water distribution and wastewater system for the city.

**Water Supply System Design**\
Using population growth estimates, the city’s future water demand was calculated, which summed up to a total peak demand of 600 $m^3/h$. With the peak demand I designed a pipeline network designed which has two main supply zones (north & south of the river). The water is drawn upstream from the river, treated, and stored centrally. The pipeline calculations considered: pressure loss, pipe diameters, and water flow rates.

**Wastewater & Drainage System design**\
A combined sewer system was designed for Somotillo to manage wastewater and rainwater discharge and includes overflow structures to prevent flooding. To calculate the diameter of the pipes a calculation was done which included total discharge per pipe and available pipe diameters on the market. The design for this combined sewer system can be found in the figure below.

**River Water Quality Assessment**\
To assess the environmental impact of the water system a river water quality assessment was done. Oxygen demand calculations show that untreated wastewater will deplete oxygen levels, harming aquatic life. To prevent this from happening several steps could be undertaken. For example, oxygen levels could be increased before discharging the water by making use of aeration, or wastewater treatment could be improved to reduce the pollution.

**Conclusion**\
A functional water supply and sewer system was designed for Somotillo, helping residents of this city by supplying them with clean drinking water. However, the study showed that untreated wastewater would severely impact the river’s oxygen levels.

This project taught me how the designs we, as engineers make, can significantly impact society and the environment. This means that each decision of the design phase should be carefully considered.

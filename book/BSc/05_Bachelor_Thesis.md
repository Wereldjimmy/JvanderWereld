# 5. Bachelor Thesis 3D Printed Vascular Self Healing Concrete
Throughout my thesis I investigated the impact of printing direction on the porosity and flexural strength of 3D-printed vascular self-healing concrete. The research contributes to improving durability and self-healing capabilities in concrete structures. My thesis can be downloaded {download}`here. <../Documents/BEP_3D_printed_vascular_self_healing_concrete_JvanderWereld.pdf>`

**Background and Problem Statement**\
Concrete is prone to cracking, which in turn leads to reinforcement corrosion and structural failure. To mitigate this, new technologies like self-healing concrete can be used. The self-healing concrete researched throughout my thesis used a vascular system (similar to blood vessels in nature) to transport healing agents that repair cracks and combines this with 3D-printing.

**Methodology**\
Nine specimens were created, two for each printing direction (0, 45, and 90 degrees). To compare results, three cast reference specimens were made.

*CT Scanning*\
Each type of specimen was then first scanned with a CT scanning machine to determine the porosity and investigate the internal voids.

*Three-Point Bending Test*\
After letting the specimens cure for 28 days a three-point bending test was performed to measure the strength of each specimen.

*Air-Void Model*\
I also developed a mathematical model to estimate the porosity and predict material behaviour of the specimens.

**Key Results**\
*Porosity*\
The 45 degrees printing direction had the lowest porosity (0.72%), while 0 and 90 degrees were both around 1.28% likely due to weaker layer bonding.

```

The air-void model overestimated porosity, which indicated a need for refinement.

*Flexural Strength Results*\
The 45 degrees printed specimens had the highest flexural strength (around 12.65 MPa), while the 0 degrees printed specimens had the lowest flexural strength (around 10.23 MPa). Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between porosity and strength.

**Conclusion**\
The study showed that the 45 degrees printing direction was the most efficient, offering better strength and lower porosity. This would likely be explained by the interlocking effect of this printing design. The air-void model showed a first step in the right direction, but needs improvements to better predict real-world results.

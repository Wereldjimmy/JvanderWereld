# 3. Sustainability of a Bridge
As part of the course Construction Materials and Sustainability (CTB1320), I analysed a bridge in Roelofarendsveen by calculating the Environmental Cost Indicator (MKI) value. This approach is used in the Netherlands to quantify the environmental impact of civil structures. First, a 3D model was made in the software Tekla from which a quantity statement was gathered that contained the exact weight of materials used in the bridge.

With this quantity statement the environmental impact indicator values are calculated for each material in the bridge and, on top of that, the environmental impact is assessed based on several environmental impact categories such as abiotic depletion, global warming, and ozone layer depletion.

The total impact of the bridge on the environment turned out to be â‚¬24,200, with the majority coming from human toxicity.

## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a JupyterBook that is written using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks.

The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](`https://github.com/Wereldjimmy/JvanderWereld/`). The website can be viewed at `https://wereldjimmy.github.io/JvanderWereld/main/credits.html`.

# 3. Information Systems for the Construction Industry

During Q3 of my CME year I also followed a course called Information Systems for the Construction Industry (CME4121) in which we got introduced to the possibilities and opportunities of BIM. The goal of the course was to show us how digital information systems can be utilised during the construction, operation, and maintenance of an asset. To do this, several software and techniques has been used on a specific project in the Netherlands.

**Our Case Study**\
As a project we, my groupmate and I, chose The Blox project in the Binckhorst, The Hague, the Netherlands. The Blox was at the time in construction and planned to be a 130-meter-tall residential tower consisting of 38 floors and 360 apartments, and started construction in July 2024.

**Created Artifacts**\
Firstly, a BIM model was created of The Blox using Revit 2025. Three systems were created (Structural, Architectural, and MEP) which were later merged into one model.

After this was done, a clash detection was performed using Autodesk Navisworks to identify all the clashed in our model. From all these clashes (267 initially), we picked three clashes to resolve by hand. The clashed that we picked had to do with the intersection between components of the structural model and the MEP model. 

Then, a 5D simulation was made of The Blox in which the viewer can see how The Blox gets build up throughout time and with the costs development.

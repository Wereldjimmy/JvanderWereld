# MSc Construction Management and Engineering

During the second year of my master's degree, I attended courses tied to the Construction Management and Engineering degree. The year started with general courses about law, financial engineering, and intercultural collaboration. These courses were the building blocks for the courses of the second quarter during which I attended a course about collaboration. The main objective of this course was to learn how to work in big teams. This was done by creating a big group of students (approximately 26 students) and consulting Rijkswaterstaat on the Eastern Scheldt barrier. Furthermore, I did a course on project management and asset management during this quarter.

During the third quarter, it was time to attend courses based on the graduation domain. I chose to follow courses in the Systems and Decision Support graduation domain, which included a course about optimisation. Next to the graduation domain courses, there were also general courses for everyone to take. That is why I also attended courses like Information Systems for the Construction Industry, and Ethics and Engineering during this quarter. I am currently in this quarter and looking forward to the future of this year.

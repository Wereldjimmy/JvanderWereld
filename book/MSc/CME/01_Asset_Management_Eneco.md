# 1. Asset Management Analysis of Eneco

For the course Engineering Asset Management (CME4300) I, together with three other students, was tasked with analysing a service provider. We chose Eneco, which is a major energy provider in Europe. The analysis evaluates operational strategies, challenges, quality of service, asset management, and sustainability initiatives.

**Introduction to Eneco & Challenges in Renewable Energy**\
Eneco is a big energy provider active in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and the UK. Eneco's goal is to achieve climate neutrality by 2035, but it is coming across some challenges in reaching this goal. The first challenge Eneco has to deal with is grid congestion. This is a major problem and needs to be addressed to balance renewable energy supply with demand. The second challenge is integrating new technologies, like hydrogen storage and battery systems, into existing infrastructure. Meanwhile, public concerns about the environmental impact of wind farms form another layer of complexity in reaching its goal. 

**Eneco’s Quality of Service & Sustainability Initiatives**\
To further analyse Eneco we looked into the services and sustainability initiatives Eneco provides. Eneco has been expanding its offshore and onshore wind farms, to maintain a reliable and sustainable energy supply. Eneco also invests in large-scale battery storage systems and virtual power plants to stabilize energy distribution.

For cities, Eneco offers district heating networks, which play a crucial role in reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. Eneco has also taken steps to directly engage with its customers in this energy transition. This is done through Toon smart thermostats, which households can use to monitor and optimise their energy consumption, while Crowd Nett enables homeowners with solar panels and batteries to contribute surplus energy back into the grid. By 2030, Eneco aims to provide 100% green electricity, and by 2025, it plans to phase out gas-fired boilers, making a decisive shift away from fossil fuels.

**Stakeholder Engagement**\
To analyse the relations of Eneco we mapped the stakeholders of Eneco. The major group of stakeholders include customers like households, businesses, and municipalities. Furthermore, Eneco collaborates with the Dutch government and the European Union for funding support. TenneT is also an important stakeholder since it manages the electricity grid in the Netherlands. 

Mapping these stakeholders showed us that conflicts may arise between them. For example, local opposition to wind parks may arise due to noise and landscape impacts and grid capacity limitations may delay new projects which limits the expansion capacity of Eneco. 

**Strategic Asset Management Plan for Wind Parks**\
A Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) was developed for the wind parks of Eneco. This includes maintenance optimisation by making use of the 3C concept (Centralize, Cluster, Calculate). This consolidates maintenance activities reducing downtime and costs.

To address the financial feasibility of this plan a Net Present Value (NPV) calculation has been done. The results of that can be seen in the figure below.

**Systems Engineering for Wind Parks**\
After the SAMP, the Systems Engineering of a wind park was addressed. This started with the development of a systems and functional breakdown structure of a windmill. The system breakdown structure can be seen in the figure below.

After creating these breakdown structures, a life cycle approach was created. This approach will help Eneco manage wind parks throughout the lifespan of the assets. It involves considering all phases, from the planning and design phase to the decommissioning phase. 

To address verification and validation, Eneco could make use of the V-model. This model makes sure that validation is done systematically during the whole lifecycle of a wind park project, making sure the project is ‘fit-for-purpose’. At last, interface management is addressed.

**What did I learn**\
During this project and course, it became clear to me how important asset management is. Before, I only thought about creating something, but I never really realised that the operation and maintenance of the things you create are equally as important. This course showed me how systematic management of assets can be done, and I am sure I will use this in my future career.

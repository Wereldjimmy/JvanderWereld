# MSc Structural Engineering

Directly after finishing my bachelor's degree, I started with my double master’s degree. Since it is a double master’s degree the layout was a bit different than normal. During my first year, I only did courses tied to the Structural Engineering master’s degree, while for my second year, I only did courses tied to the Construction Management and Engineering master’s degree. My third year will be a bit different since it will combine the two master’s degrees. In my third year, I will do an internship, one course, thesis preparation and my combined master’s thesis which will be 40 credits excluding the preparation.

As said above, I attended courses tied to the Structural Engineering degree during my first year. The year started with two courses which were not directly linked to Structural Engineering but were needed to set the foundation for later courses. In these first two courses, I refreshed the knowledge I gained during my bachelor’s degree and gained some general knowledge on differential equations and programming with Git. After this first quarter, I started doing a Structural Engineering base course which included topics like slender structure mechanics and dynamics, and assessing concrete, steel and wooden structures based on the Eurocode. In the third quarter it was time to choose a specification, also called A-module in the master’s degree. I chose module A1 which was about structural mechanics and dynamics. Several topics were discussed during this module, including signal processing and analysis, stability of structures, and finite element analysis (FEA). This module, together with my interest in programming, made me choose applied mechanics of structures in the fourth quarter of the year. During this module, we investigated computational modelling, advanced constitutive modelling, and advanced mechanics of structures. During this year the work pace was very high, but I never learned this much in one year.

In the summer of my first year of the master’s degree, I also attended a study tour to South Korea with the study association U-BASE of Structural Engineering. During this trip, I was surrounded by 24 other students and two lecturers while visiting Seoul, Busan, and Incheon. This trip was insightful and showed me a completely different culture. During this trip, we visited the University of Seoul, companies, and went to various cultural areas in the cities we visited. I was fortunate to be present at the trip and will never forget the experience.
